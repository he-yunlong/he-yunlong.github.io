{"name":"Yunlong's personal page","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to my personal page.\r\nI am currently a sixth year PhD student in the Computational Science & Engineering program, at Georgia Tech. My research interests include machine learning and numerical optimization.\r\n\r\nContact:\r\nAddress: 686 Cherry Street, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0160\r\nOffice: 167 Skiles\r\nEmail: heyunlong (AT) gatech.edu\r\n\r\n#### About Me:\r\nI work with Prof. Haesun Park matrix factorization methods for data mining. I am also working on nonlinear optimization problems with Prof. Renato Monteiro. Before I came to Georgia Tech in the fall of 2009, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I got my M.S. degree in Statistics in 2013\r\n\r\n#### Manuscripts:\r\n- Y. He, R. D. C.
